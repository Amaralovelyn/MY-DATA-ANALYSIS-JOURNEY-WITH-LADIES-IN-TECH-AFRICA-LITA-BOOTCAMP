### FOUNDATION OF DATA
We need to have some level of Data literacy, this is how we should perceive Data, some of the different that our data can be on for us to do certain things or make meaning out of that Dataset. This leads us to know:

#### HOW DATA IS GENERATED.
Data generation is a very important phase in data life cycle. The way a data is generated will actually impact some of the things you are able to do with your data afterwards.
 For Example, there are numbers of Data we can gather from this class/training, we can get data set of participants from this class and part of the data point we will be able to get is the Participant’s name, Gender, Location, occupation etc, all these are the individual data points and when we put all together (attributes of all participant) that would be a dataset. Data point – a single attribute within the data set while Dataset – collection of Data points. You would not run analysis of any Data point you fail to Capture. The better we generate our data the more value we get from our Dataset, this is to say that ‘’the way we handle Data generation is stringent to the value we would get from our data. 

#### DATA STORAGE.
Data comes in different structures when generated, whatever the structure is, we need to store the data in a particular location so that the Dataset will be accessible. 
 There are typically 2 ways to stored data.
i. Premises, here the data sits within the four walls of the organization e.g Server (a centralized system) and cannot be accessed outside the premise of the organization.
ii. Cloud, implies our data are stored in Data centers of some providers e.g Microsoft.
 Note: How your data is stored will impact how you will retrieve it.

Examples of different data sources:
Microsoft Access
SQL Server
My SQL
Postgres 
Excel
Oracle
Cassandra etc
 
#### DATA STRUCTURE.
There are 3 ways by which data can be structured when data is retrieved or generated. 

Below are three structures data can assume:

- Structured Data: This means that Data is in Tabular Format or Table Format. Structured Data are 99% ready for analysis
- Semi-Structure Data: Data is not in Table Format but in a format like Json (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language).
- Unstructured Data: These are data set that comes in form of files like media files-audio or video files.

ETL Extract Transform and Load. If our Data need some restructuring which means its not in a tabular Format, then we need to do what is called ETL. This a technical term to Transform data to get the needed structure. That is taking Data from a particular structure to a structure that is ANALYSIS READY.

#### DATA ANALYSIS.
We can only run Analysis when a dataset is stored.

#### STATISTICS.
One of the key tools that will help us to run our analysis properly and draw conclusion and inferences from our data set is to do some level of statistics, that is applying some statistical measures that will help us in decision making.
 
#### DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING.
After all done we have to make some decision based on the analyzed dataset.

 The 2 Systems Every Organization Runs
1. Operational Systems, the Organization uses this system to execute their business processes. They use it to manage their business process. Whatever system that is generating data for you is an Operation System within the business. Examples are zoom, Teams, Oracles etc
2. Analytic Systems, use to evaluate business processes. Example Power BI, Excel, Tableau, Google Data studio etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE
These are the things you would typically do when you want to analyze data. They are as shown below:
 
#### Ingest – Transformation – Modelling – Visualization – Analysis - Presentation

DATA INGESTION, this is the first thing to do, to connect to data source, to socket in, to bring it into the tool that you want to use for analysis. Once data is brought in, you need to do some TRANSFORMATION of the data, in some case you may want to add, drop some columns or turn your data in certain ways you want etc. Then MODELLING, after Transformation, the data from different source will be brought close to each other for the Analyst to be able to see and use them to bring out a single report. Then VISUALIZATION is turning the data into visuals, charts, graphs. Visualization is what many people would see. Then ANALYSIS, analysis is beyond visualization, this is when to bring in Statistical tools/measures to work on dataset to make better sense of data set. Then PRESENTATION, you would now present your outcome, your findings to the stakeholders of the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### WHY DO WE RUN DATA ANALYSIS:
For monitoring business growth
To identify patterns
To know the progress of a business etc

For Business owners: 
-         Make more money
-         Reduce cost
-         Increase Market Share

As an Analyst, your analysis should strike one of these 3 areas:
-         What is working
-         What is not working
-         What we should focus on

The analysis must be able to figure out what is working, what is not working for example after running promotion or ads on a particular line of business. The analysis should also figure out what should be focus on for example different outlets/branches that bring the major revenue.

### MICROSOFT EXCEL

#### INTRODUCTION TO MICROSOFT EXCEL

Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet application that is needed or used to store, manage, calculate and analyze data. Excel works with calculation
 
Two categories of Microsoft Office product:
1. A paid product: Is subscription based, its updated monthly, it is online 
2. A standalone product: They are updated every 3 years, it has been packaged for installation, sits on the laptop without being connected to the cloud.
 
When you launch Microsoft Excel, you launch a blank workbook and within the workbook, you have multiple worksheet, this is to say that a workbook houses the worksheet. 
 
At the top of the workbook is the Ribbon Interface, within the Ribbon Interface we have the different Tabs, within each Tab we have Group, within each Group we have Buttons/Commands. Under the Ribbon Interface we have the Formula Bar. Above the Ribbon Interface and Tabs is the Quick Access tool bar, its where you can put some buttons that you want to access quickly.
 
On the worksheet, the alphabets A, B, C ETC are the Columns while the numbers 1, 2, 3 etc are the Rows, this means we have Rows going from top to bottom and Columns from left to right. We have 1,048,576 Rows and 16,384 Columns in Excel. To know this, stay anywhere on the blank workbook, hold on Ctrl key and press down arrow, this takes you to the last row. Also hold on to Ctrl key and press forward arrow and that take you to the last column FXD, so column FXD is the last column. The usefulness of this information specially on the number of Rows is to know when to open another workbook because once you hit the maximum, Excel can no longer take your data.

### DATA ENTRY IN EXCEL 

#### DATA ENTRY FUNDAMENTALS

The key thing in Excel is how to handle/manage data entry. Because many people use excel as data entry tool and this data might get to us as Analysis ready or not depending on how the data entry was handled, in other case you might create a template for people to manage data entry. So as an analyst you are to know how to do data entry in excel, how to do it well, efficiently and in a productive manner.

Data entry is the process of manually entering data into cells within a spreadsheet. Microsoft Excel is saved by default as .xls or .xlsx. Anything typed into a cell in excel is treated as a text or number. Texts usually are left aligned while Numbers are right aligned.
"Autofit" in Excel data entry means automatically adjusting the width of a column to perfectly fit the largest piece of data entered within that column, ensuring all text is visible without needing manual resizing; you can achieve this by selecting the column, and double-clicking on the boundary between column headers, or using the keyboard shortcut "Alt + H + O + I" to autofit all columns and "Alt + H + O + I" to autofit rows in a selection.
 An active cell is the cell in a spreadsheet that is currently selected for data entry.
 A cell is the intersection between the column and the row, a cell has address, the name box tells the address of any single cell
 
#### How do we start data entry in Excel
- Select the desired cell
- Type the data directly into the cell
- Tab to move to the next cell

#### Key steps for data entry in Excel:
- Open your Excel workbook: Launch Excel and open the spreadsheet where you want to enter data. 
- Select a cell: Click on the specific cell where you want to enter data. 
- Type the data: Enter the text, number, or date directly into the active cell. 
- Navigate to the next cell: Press "Tab" to move to the cell to the right or "Enter" to move to the cell below.
 
#### Data entry using Excel form
- Add form to the Quick Access Toolbar: Click on quick access toolbar, more commands, excel options, add the "Form". 
- Select a cell within your data: Stay anywhere around the data and click on any cell within the data you are entering. 
- Activate the form: Click on the "Form" button on the Quick Access Toolbar to open the data entry form. 
- Enter data in the form: The form will display each column header as a field, allowing you to type data into each field individually. 
- Add new records: Click "New" on the form to add a new row of data

### DATA VALIDATION 
This implies the reduction in input or entries into workbook to certain predefined items. It’s Data Cleaning that involves checking the accuracy and quality of source data before using, importing or otherwise processing data.

#### Steps to add data validation to cells or range in excel
-	Highlight the cell you want to validate
-	Then on Data Tab click on Data Validation
-	Or using shortcut, after highlighting the cell, press alt AVV
-	Select List from the Allow box on the Settings tab
-	Type the list values in the Source box, separated by commas
-	Select the In-cell dropdown check box 

#### To add Text validation
 - Create a Named Range by clicking on Define Name on the Formulas Tab
 - Then, Select a cell or range
 - Press ALT AVV
 - Allow list
 - =created Named Range
 - Ok
 - This gives a dropdown option from which you can select.

NB: Named Range: Is giving a set of items a single name so that you can refer to them somewhere

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FORMATTING IN EXCEL

#### How can we clear or update validation
-	Highlight the cell
-	Press ALT AVV
-	Update as necessary
-	Or clear all and the column will be back to default
  
#### To Modify Validation error message
-	Select a cell
-	Press ALT AVV
-	Click error alert
-	Modify the title (Wrong Entry) and error message (Please select from the drop-down options) boxes
-	ok
